# DrowsinessDetection
The Driver Drowsiness Detection Dataset consists of all the images that record the drivers' drowsiness at different stages by means of eye aperture detection, head movement, and facial recognition. This is complemented by the addition of the DDD, which shows images of drivers being engaged in various states of vigilance, and the MRL Eye Dataset, which displays images of eyes from fully wide-open to closing. The set is meant for training AI models to spot the beginning signs of drowsiness even in real-time applications, such as safety control systems tools. The brilliance of such a system, for instance, clues eyes that are almost closing (which could be an indication of drowsiness), is that it alerts drivers, such as vibration and sound systems, when they are at risk of falling asleep, thus saving lives. The data set could also cover safety areas like driverless cars, human involvement, and workplace monitoring due to the measurement and response functions of the system. By doing so, the prevention of accidents and keeping the workers in a state of alertness can be ensured.
